# (Don't judge please)
This is a project of mine from 11th grade when I was just beginning to get excited about computer science.
I had very little experience with java graphics so I hard coded everything, including the piece designs (facepalm).
Very Buggy.

# How to play
White goes first.
Click on a piece you'd like to move and then click on the square you like to move to. 
You will be prevented from performing illegal moves.
